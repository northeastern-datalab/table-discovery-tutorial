Abstract
--------

The ubiquity of data lakes has created fascinating new challenges for data 
management research. In this tutorial, we review the state-of-the-art in data 
management for data lakes. We consider how data lakes are introducing new 
problems including dataset discovery and how they are changing the requirements 
for classic problems including data extraction, data cleaning, data integration, 
data versioning, and metadata management.
